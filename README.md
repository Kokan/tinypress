## Tinypress

### About

Tinypress allows you create and manage your Github page blog. It uses the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/) to provide [Jekyll's](http://jekyllrb.com/) implementation through a simple interface.

### Languages and Database

The core of the site is powered by PHP. The markdown parsers are written in Ruby. The client side is, ofcourse, HTML, CSS and Javascript (Backbone). The database is MySQL. MySQL stores template configurations, scheduled posts, saved posts and profile details. Redis is used to cache posts pulled from Github to prevent incessant API polling.
